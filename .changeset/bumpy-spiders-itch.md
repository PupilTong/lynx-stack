chore: unbind `@lynx-js/web-worker-rpc` version with lynx's web platform

This package supports cross-threads(web worker) rpc for lynx's web platform.

It's based on browser `MessagePort`.

Compare with vscode-jsonrpc, it have less package size, which is very important for Web Application.

Documents will be added later.
